generic algorithm to calculate the lagrange dynamics of serial robot manipulators and implementing it using Matlab

Derivation of the dynamic model of a manipulator plays an important role for simulation of motion, analysis of manipulator structures, and design of control algorithms. The dynamic model of a manipulator provides a description of the relationship between the joint actuator torques and the motion of the structure. With Lagrange formulation, the equations of motion can be derived in a systematic way independently of the reference coordinate frame. Once a set of variables qi,i=1,...,n termed generalised coordinates, are chosen which
effectively describe the link positions of ann-DOF manipulator, the Lagrangian of the mechanical system can be defined as a function of the generalised coordinates.
